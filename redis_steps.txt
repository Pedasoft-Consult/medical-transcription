Here are a few steps you might take to resolve this issue:

    Check Redis Installation and Configuration:
        Ensure that Redis is correctly installed and running on your server.
        Verify that your application is pointing to the correct Redis server address and port.

    Review the Code:
        Look at the place in your code where Redis is being initialized. The error suggests that there might be an incorrect method or attribute being called (replace in this case).
        Ensure that the Redis-client is being used correctly. You might want to check the documentation for the version of the Redis client library you are using.

    Update Dependencies:
        Make sure that all your dependencies, including the Redis client library, are up-to-date.

    Error Logs:
        Check other logs or messages around the same time for more context or additional errors that might help diagnose the issue.

    Test in Development:
        Before making changes in production, try replicating the issue and potential fixes in a development environment.

If these steps do not resolve the issue, you might want to consult the documentation for your specific Redis client or seek assistance from a developer familiar with your tech stack.
